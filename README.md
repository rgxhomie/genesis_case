## Features

### 1. Get Current Rate

You can trigger the `/api/rate` endpoint to get the current rate. The rate is cached for 5 minutes to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary calls to the rate provider.

**Endpoint:**

GET /api/rate

### 2. Subscribe to Rate Updates

You can trigger the /api/subscribe endpoint to subscribe an email address to daily rate updates. Subscribers will receive an email every day with the latest rate information.

**Endpoint:**

POST /api/subscribe

#### Request body

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

### 3. Daily Email Updates

A cron job runs every day to send emails to all subscribed users with the latest rate information. This ensures that subscribers are always informed about the current rate.
